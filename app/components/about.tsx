          <p>Iâ€™m a Dev. I learn languages for a living. And I love it.</p>
          <p className='indent-8'>
            With several years of experience creating, implementing, and
            contributing to the development and design and of interactive
            websites and custom applications, I am fluent in Typescript,
            ReactJS, NextJS, API calls, and several Javascript languages, frameworks,
            and libraries. Though I have spent substantial time personally
            contracted to build apps and websites for a wide variety of products
            and causes, I truly love working on a team. I&apos;m known for my
            communication skills and enjoy collaborating with all members, from
            frontend to backend to UX/UI designers to management to client.
            Working smart and being diligent, but never afraid to reach out for
            extra eyes and input, is what leads to efficiency in the development
            environment.
