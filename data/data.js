  body: "My primary enjoyment is derived from music: playing, listening, composing, as well as instrument design and construction.  Having done plenty of repairs on instruments belonging to my bluegrass banjo students, my love for woodworking quickly trainsitioned into luthiery: the hand-making of stringed instruments. Though I predominantly build banjos, I have made a variety of other instruments and am currently constructing my first Irish bouzouki: one of my favorite instruments to play. Music has given me the opportunity to travel to multiple continents to perform as well as to teach; I've toured New Zealand on multiple occasions, spent several months in Uganda as a house band in a local bar, and most recently my bluegrass band was awarded a federal grant issued by the US State Department to tour in eastern Russia. I enjoy teaching others and have taught classes to both individuals and through various colleges and universities. I have always loved experiencing foreign cultures, often an eye-opening and humbling experience, and spent my college years in Cork in the south of Ireland. As part of my degree, I studied Gaeilge, the native Irish language, and love to converse with anyone else who shares this arcane interest. Myself and my colleague run a non-profit that puts on the Bridgetown Bluegrass & Folk Festival each year, earning money to build shelters for those in need as well as fund youth music programs. I also posses a strong interest in fermentation science, having spent twelve years as a brewer and cider maker, and enjoy building stills of my own design for making spirits and tinctures at home. Currently I live with my wife and our two young lads in Portland, Oregon, the city I grew up in.",
