  body: "My primary passion is music, most specifically bluegrass banjo, from which I made the majority of my income before entering web development five years ago. I enjoy wood working, which quickly turned into doing minor work repair work on instruments for my music students before trainsitioning into full-on luthiery: the hand-making of stringed instruments. I tend to focus primarily on banjos, but currently I am building my first Irish bouzouki, one of my favorite instruments to play. Having been given the opportunity to travel to multiple continents playing music, I've toured New Zealand on multiple occasions, spent several months in Uganda as a house band in a local bar, and most recently my bluegrass band was awarded a federal grant issued by the US State Department to tour in eastern Russia. I enjoy teaching others and have taught classes to both individuals and through various colleges and universities. I have always loved experiencing foreign cultures, often an eye-opening and humbling experience, and spent my college years in Cork in the south of Ireland. As part of my degree, I studied Gaeilge, the native Irish language, and love to converse with anyone else who shares this arcane interest. Myself and my colleague run a non-profit that puts on the Bridgetown Bluegrass Festival each year, earning money for homeless shelters and youth music programs. I also posses a strong interest in fermentation science, having spent twelve years as a brewer and cider maker, and enjoy building my own stills for making spirits and tinctures at home. Currently I live with my wife and our two young lads in Portland, the city where I grew up.",};
